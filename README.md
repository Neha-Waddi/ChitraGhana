# ðŸŽµ Chitraghana - Emotion-Based Music Recommender ðŸŽ­

Chitraghana is a facial expression-based music recommendation web app that detects the user's emotion in real-time using their webcam and plays an appropriate song. The emotion detection is powered by a CNN model trained on the FER2013 dataset, and the songs are selected based on your mood.
