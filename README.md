# ðŸŽµ Chitraghana - Emotion-Based Music Recommender ðŸŽ­

Chitraghana is a facial expression-based music recommendation web app that detects the user's emotion in real-time using their webcam and plays an appropriate locally stored song. The emotion detection is powered by a trained CNN model on the FER2013 dataset.

## ðŸ“¸ Features

- Real-time webcam capture using React and `react-webcam`.
- Emotion detection with a TensorFlow model trained on FER dataset.
- Flask backend for model inference.
- Emotion-to-song mapping based on local MP3 files.
- Auto-play emotion-based songs via HTML5 audio.
